	% FUNCTION linalg_lu
	% Purpose: Breaks a matrix A into a lower diagonal matrix, an upper
	% diagonal matrix, and a permutation matrix.
	%
	% Function call: [L, U, P] = linalg_lu(A)
	%
	% Input: A = Input matrix to be broken down. Coefficients of x of system of
	%   equations
	% b = solutions to the system of equations
	%
	% Outputs: L = lower diagonal matrix
	% U = upper diagonal matrix
	% P = Permutation matrix
